# TestRail Scripts

This set of scripts helps uploading test results from Junit format to testrail.
At the moment this script only supports Junit files generated by TCF.

Install all requirements using:

```
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you set your email and token in the relevant scripts.

We suggest to create a python virtual environment for this.

To upload all junit results from a directory, use the following command:

```
$ report.py -j <junit> -V v1.13.0-1386-g183e7445c6.2379   -p 5 -s 23 -m 8
```
